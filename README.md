# Java Code Labs

Welcome to my Java Code Labs repository!

This repository contains a collection of Java projects and laboratories developed for study and practice. Each project is designed to explore different concepts and features of the Java programming language and its ecosystem.

## Structure

The repository is organized into weekly directories (e.g., `week-001`, `week-002`, etc.). Each weekly folder contains one or more projects related to the topics covered during that specific period.

Each project is a self-contained Maven project.

## How to Use

To explore a specific project, navigate to its directory. For example:

```bash
cd week-001/laboratory-1
```

You can then use standard Maven commands to build, test, and run the project.

Enjoy exploring the code!
